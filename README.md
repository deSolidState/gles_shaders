#GLES 2.0 Shaders

## This is a repository of gles shaders I made for use on the open source r_e_c_u_r project - https://github.com/langolierz/r_e_c_u_r. They will also work with Erogenous Tones' Structure: Eurorack Visual Generator Module - http://erogenous-tones.com/modules/structure/

Some of the shaders I created myself
Many of these are converted/hacked from Shadertoy
Many of these are converted/hacked ISF shaders

To be explicit, the converted shaders retain their licensing unless expressly stated otherwise. Some of the shaders were already mixed and mashed together when I discovered them, in any case, I have tried to give credit to the chain of creators inside the code of each.

Please keep to the same ethos.
