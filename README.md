#GLES 2.0 Shaders

## This is a repository of gles shaders I made for use on the open source r_e_c_u_r project - https://github.com/langolierz/r_e_c_u_r.

## They will also work with Erogenous Tones' Structure: Eurorack Visual Generator Module - http://erogenous-tones.com/modules/structure/

Some of the shaders I created myself  
Many of these are converted/hacked from Shadertoy  
Many of these are converted/hacked ISF shaders

## LICENSING
To be explicit, unless expressly stated otherwise the shaders converted/hacked from ISF (Interactive Shader Format) and Shadertoy are open-source.

ISF shaders are licensed under the MIT License [https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/], thus, everyone can use them for commercial or noncommercial applications completely free of charge with proper attribution.

Shadertoy shaders are licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License (CC BY-NC-SA) [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/deed.en_US], which allows for sharing and non-commercial use with proper attribution, any derivatives must be explicitly licensed under the same license.

Furthermore, any shaders I create are open-source and licensed under the (CC BY-NC-SA) license. Again, this license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon the shaders for non-commercial purposes as long you provide me proper attribution and license any derivative shaders under the identical terms. The ONLY EXCEPTION to this is that I allow commercial usages for VJs who do LIVE paid performances. If you are using a shader to create an advertisement/movie/video, etc. this is covered by the CC BY-NC-SA license, but reach out to me, we might be able to work something out!

Some of the shaders were already mixed and mashed together when I discovered them, in any case, I have tried to give proper attribution to the chain of creators inside the code of each.

Overall, please try to keep to the remix and reuse ethos.
